This project is basically a huge VHDL experiment. This project is focused on only testbenching.

The project uses GHDL:
https://github.com/tgingold/ghdl
And gtkwave, but that should be in your repo's.

Usage of GHDL:

http://ghdl.readthedocs.org/en/latest/index.html

Running happens using the Makefile in the project directory. Type `make` to make GHDL scan and process all VHDL files specified, type `make run` to run the testbench (implies `make`) and type `make simulate` to start gtkwave with the generated output file (implies `make run`).
